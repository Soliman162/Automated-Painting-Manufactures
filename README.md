# Automated Prouduction Line of High Quality painting Manufactures

I have managed to design and implement a Automated Prouduction with 3 main stages 
- Feeding
- Filling 
- Capping

### Sequence 

After Reciving the number of bottels that should be fiiled the Stepper Motor of the feeding line start to rotate
To Delevir the bootel to Rotary after that the rotary disk start to rotate until it delever the bottel to the filling stage
the filling stage takes 4 sec then the rotary disk rotate to delever the bootel to the capping stage then it rotate again 
to delever the bottel to the exit line and this process keep running until filling all the bottels
